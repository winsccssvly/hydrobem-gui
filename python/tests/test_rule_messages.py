"""The item names in the messages of the rules exist in the schema.

A rule names the items it refuses (`first_order.motion = true requires ...`,
`control_surface_waterline_term = 'body' needs second_order.drift_control_surface`). When an item
is renamed, a message that still names the old item compiles and passes every test that does not
trip it. This test reads the string literals of the engine's sources (the rule layers of
docs/development/architecture.md, "Where a rule goes") and checks the names they give:

- `section.item`, where `section` is a single object of the model (`first_order`,
  `second_order`, `options`, `environment`): `item` is an item of its type (followed by a
  placeholder of `format!` or by `...`, as in `second_order.free_surface_{name}`: the start of
  one);
- `name = value` with a value `true`, `false`, a quoted text or a list, or a `name` with an
  underscore: `name` is an item of some type of the schema (`x = 0`, `omega = inf` are not names
  of items).
