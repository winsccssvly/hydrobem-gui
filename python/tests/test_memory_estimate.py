"""The memory estimate of a solve.

Model.memory_estimate counts the arrays of a solve from the sizes of the problem: the resident peak is
the statics plus frequency_threads times the workspace of one frequency plus the outputs; the
workspace grows with the inner threads by the characters solved at once and the parts of the packing
buffers of the matrix products they write; the commit charge adds the rest of those buffers, which
every thread running a product keeps; a hydrostatics problem needs none; the potential QTF's
sub-problems raise the peak beyond the model's own solve; a solve whose peak exceeds the available memory
is refused before it starts. These are exact identities of the count. The hooks of the environment
(the test hook HB_AVAILABLE_MEMORY of the memory check, the validation hooks HB_VALIDATE_<name>)
are refused when their value does not parse, and one that changes the numbers is a warning.
How close the count comes to the measured peaks of a solve depends on the machine (the processor,
its memory system, the thread count): it is calibrated there. Five cases are measured here by
the process's peak working set (Windows): the second order of the indirect method of the
potential QTF, whose steps between the sub-problems hold the peak, at f = 1 and 3; the field
outputs of both methods; and the direct method of the potential QTF. Meshes are procedural (tests/python/meshes.py)."""
