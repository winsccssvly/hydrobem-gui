"""The higher-order method (one body in open sea, flat and
B-spline patches, any depth, limits, field points, RAO, interior free-surface
and prescribed-pressure patches, the item panel_size, walls, several bodies).

theory §7 / test-plan B, each test on the basis it rests on: identities of the problem (symmetry
sectors and the symmetry of a system equal the full solve, a wall equals the mirror body, the total
and scattered formulations, Haskind and pressure exciting forces, also for the pressure modes and
thin sheets, the axisymmetry of the heave flow next to the pole of a cylinder's bottom patch, a
closed sheet side split like any side, the thread counts); the closed forms of the pressure-mode
restoring; the analytic irregular frequency of a box, removed by an interior patch; the input rules
(panel_size, routes that are not available). The higher order against the extrapolated low order
of the same geometry (the B-spline cylinder, the air-cushion vessel, the damping lid, thin sheets)
and the quadrature orders against each other are validation, run when the method changes, not
tests. Meshes are procedural (tests/python/meshes.py)."""
