"""Free-surface plates of a tank's free surface (theory §10.2, §9.7).

A plate of a tank's free surface z = Z_T (a deck over part of a tank, a full cover) is a plate of
the tank problem, moving with every mode of the hull. A fully covered tank is a closed container
full of liquid: its potential for a translation is the translation itself, so the tank's added
mass is the fluid mass rho_T V_T at every frequency, its damping zero, and heave is defined at
omega = 0; its restoring is that of a solid of the fluid's weight (the plate's area leaves the
free-surface term rho_T g A_T). At omega = 0 the free surface is rigid, so a plate with no
normal velocity (surge, sway, yaw) changes nothing there; a cover of vanishing area tends to the
open tank. A plate of the sea over a tank's fluid (a floating roof as a body of its own) is
refused. Meshes are procedural (tests/python/meshes.py)."""
