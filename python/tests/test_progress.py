"""Progress reports and the cancel request inside the steps of a solve.

A one-argument callback receives a Progress for the stages (the statics first, then the
assembly, the LU and the outputs of each frequency), at most every 0.1 s, and for every finished
frequency; a two-argument callback receives (done, total) after each frequency. Returning False
in the LU of the first frequency cancels the solve before it ends; returned from the two-argument
form it cancels between frequencies, and an exception raised in a callback ends the solve with it.
A callback does not change the results; the model refuses its changes and queries while it
calculates. Every frequency runs on a frequency worker of a fixed number (0 to f - 1); the phases
come in their order; the second-order steps (the quadratic QTF's rows, the sub-problems, the outer
integral and the pairs of the potential QTF) report their items as the frequencies, and a cancel
inside them stops the solve within a second. Meshes are procedural (tests/python/meshes.py)."""
