"""Regression baselines (tests/data/regression): every output of the problems of
regression_problems.py equals the stored HydroBEM result to 1e-5 of the largest value of
its entry over the first axis (the frequencies, or the points), at least 1e-3 of the peak of
the array: a small coefficient is held to its own size (single-precision
outputs; a change of method moves results far more), plus ATOL in SI units for an entry whose
exact value is zero and whose computed value is round-off (the waterplane centroid of a
symmetric body, about 1e-16: its own size is its round-off; a value above 1e-9 is still held to
RTOL). A failure after an intended change: regenerate with
scripts/gen_regression_baselines.py and give the reason in the commit.

The baselines are the results of the machine that wrote them. Another processor sums in another
order (its linear-algebra kernels and their cache blocking), and cancellation in the second-order
outputs and the body-point velocities amplifies that round-off to about 6e-4 of an array's peak (a
continuous-integration runner). There (CI=true, set by the runner) each entry is held to
OTHER_MACHINE of the peak of its array instead."""
