"""Bodies in a channel of finite depth, low and higher order (theory §1.2, test-plan B).

Each check on the basis it rests on. Identities of the problem: the field satisfies the wall
condition dphi/dy = 0 on y = +-W/2; a body and its mirror image about the centreline give mirrored
results; symmetry sectors equal the full solve; no reflection (channel_reflect = 0) is the open sea;
the Haskind and the pressure exciting force agree and A, B are symmetric as for the same body in
open water; the limits with and without an interior surface; the control-surface drift does not
depend on the surface. Asymptotics: the omega = inf images decay like exp(-pi R / 2h); A(omega) -
A(0) falls like omega^2. Input rules: routes that are not available are rejected. Damping lids,
thin sheets and dampers (both methods): no reflection is the open sea, the mirror body, a lid or a
damper without damping is none, a rigid damper is the sheet. The comparisons of discretizations
(the wall effect of the higher order against the low order, the slabs that tend to the sheet, the
widening channel) are validation, run when the method changes, not tests. The kernel itself is
tested in crates/hydrobem/tests (Faddeeva function, lattice sum against mpmath, tail tiles). Meshes
are procedural."""
