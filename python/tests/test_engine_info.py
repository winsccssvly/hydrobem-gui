"""The build of the engine library and the table of its result quantities.

The build reports the engine's version, a commit, the compiler and the linear-algebra library it
is built with (faer and its version). Every result quantity has a name, a type,
axes and a unit: the names are those of the Python binding (the attributes of hb.Results), and the
type and the number of axes are those of the arrays a solve returns."""
