"""Internal tanks, low order (theory §10.2).

A tank adds to the body its own radiation problem and restoring. At omega = 0
(a rigid lid) the tank fluid surges with the walls, at omega = inf (phi = 0
on the free surface) it heaves with them, so the tank's added mass is the
fluid mass rho_T V_T there; at omega = 0 a mode with a net flux through the
walls (heave) has no solution and is NaN; the tank radiates no waves,
its computed damping is small away from the sloshing modes; its
free surface reduces C33 by rho_T g A_T; density 0 is the body without the
tank; the first sloshing mode of a rectangular tank sits at
omega^2 = g k tanh(k h), k = pi / L; a circular tank forced in surge and pitch has the added mass of
the closed-form series (Faltinsen & Timokha 2009). Each on one mesh with the cause of its bound; the
convergence with the mesh and the higher order against a fine low-order tank are validation, run
when the method changes, not tests. Meshes are procedural (tests/python/meshes.py)."""
