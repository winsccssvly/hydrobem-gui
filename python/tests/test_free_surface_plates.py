"""Free-surface plates: massless rigid plates in z = 0 moving with their body (theory §9.7,
test-plan A and B).

Each check on the basis it rests on. Analytic: at omega = 0 a plate in z = 0 is a piston in the
rigid plane z = 0, A33(0) = rho/(2 pi) int int dS dS'/|x - x'| (Rayleigh's piston: (8/3) rho a^3
for a disc of radius a, (2/pi)(ln(1 + sqrt 2) + (1 - sqrt 2)/3) rho s^3 for a square of side s).
Semi-analytic: the disc in finite depth is the truncated cylinder of zero draft of the eigenfunction
matching of scripts/gen_cylinder_reference.py (the dock). Identities of the problem: the Haskind
relation with the plate as part of the body, the energy of the radiated wave (B33 = omega^3 |X3|^2 /
(2 rho g^3) of an axisymmetric body in deep water), A and B symmetric with B >= 0, the symmetry
sectors, both formulations, a plate of the hull's body against the same plate as a body of its own
(the rigid connection), a generalized mode of the plate's elements against the plate's heave, the
mirror image of a wall, the limit of a wetted disc of small draft, the body velocity against the
field velocity beside it and the field velocity against differences of the field pressure, a skirt
hanging from a plate whose elements end on it (converging; reference/inputs-rules §1 rule 3), the two formulations
under the piston of a deep water column (converging to one force, the total one the closer; the
choice of "auto"). A channel: no reflection is the open sea, the mirror body, the wall condition,
the rigid connection, Haskind and reciprocity, and at omega = 0 a wide channel tending to the open
sea as 1/W^2 (both methods). A body with tanks: the tank and the plates independent. The momentum
drift (theory §11.1): the far-field energy against the damping (both methods, O(h^2), O(h^3)), the
optical theorem of a fixed and a floating disc, the formulations, the sectors and head seas, its
convergence, the limits of a wetted disc of small draft and of a moonpool plugged by a wetted disc
just below the cover (the ordinary body's Kochin function without the plate's column), a
generalized piston mode against a piston body, Newman's diagonal, the low against the higher
order. The pressure drift and its quadratic QTFs (theory §11.2, §12.3) of plates whose edges lie
on walls: against the momentum drift for a cover and a piston (the change between them, which the
band under the plate carries) in both methods and for the piston of a deep water column, a
generalized piston mode against a piston body and a cover of the hull against a cover body (to
rounding), the QTF's diagonal and symmetries, a non-conforming cover. The control-surface drift
and its quadratic QTFs (theory §11.3) of a cover inside its body's control surface: against the
momentum drift (fixed and floating, both methods), the independence of the surface, the moonpool
plugged by a wetted disc just below the cover (an ordinary body's control-surface drift, every
component and the QTF), the two forms of the squared elevation, the QTF's diagonal and symmetries,
the automatic surface leaving the covered waterline out. At omega = inf (the plate a
sheet of the odd-image problem): half of Lamb's disc in heave
and pitch (both methods, converging), half of the same disc as a deep sheet (the mean of its two
limits), the square in both methods extrapolated, the cover of a hull against the cover body and the
generalized piston, A symmetric, the wall's mirror pair, finite depth tending to deep water, a channel
without reflection, and A(omega) of the dock by eigenfunction matching approaching A(inf).
The potential QTF (theory §12.4-§12.10) of plates whose edges lie on walls: the free surface ending
at a cover, a cover of the hull against a cover body, a generalized piston mode against a piston
body (the jump of the displacement at the wall), both methods converging to each other with the
panels, fixed and floating, the inner radius, the limit of the plugged moonpool, fixed and
floating, and a wall's mirror image.
Refusals: the features not available (a plate edge bordered by free surface in the pressure
drift and the potential QTF among them; a piston body inside its hull's control surface), the thin
sheets in z = 0, a plate overlapping another
surface of z = 0, a sheet meeting a plate or a lid inside an element and a sheet hanging from a
plate at omega = inf. Meshes are procedural
(tests/python/meshes.py)."""
