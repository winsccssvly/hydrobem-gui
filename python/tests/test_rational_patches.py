"""Rational B-spline patches (NURBS; reference/inputs-meshes §2).

The rational quarter circle (Piegl & Tiller 1997, §7.3) makes the cylinder and the hemisphere
exact: their points lie on the surface to rounding, the volume and the restoring are the closed
forms; the hemisphere's added mass and damping agree with Hulme (1982) to the precision of the
tables, and with the analytic sphere. The weights are kept with the mesh; a GDF file,
which has none, is not written for a rational patch; invalid weights are rejected (input rules); a
rational mesh as elements or as meshes of their own gives the same bits (the same equations). The
convergence of the rational cylinder to the analytic cylinder as the potential discretization
refines is validation, run when the method changes, not a test. The evaluation
itself (the derivatives, the two evaluators, a common factor, weights 1) is tested in
crates/hydrobem/tests/problem.rs."""
