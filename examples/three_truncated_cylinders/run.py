"""Three floating truncated vertical cylinders at the corners of an equilateral triangle, finite depth.

The case: Raghavan, Loukogeorgaki, Mantadakis, Metrikine & Lavidas (2024), HAMS-MREL, a new open
source multiple body solver for marine renewable energies, Renewable Energy 237, 121577,
doi:10.1016/j.renene.2024.121577, §3.3 "Case 3 - Three semi-submerged cylinders". It is the
three-cylinder configuration of Mavrakos (1991), Hydrodynamic coefficients for groups of interacting
vertical axisymmetric bodies, Ocean Engineering 18(5), 485-515, doi:10.1016/0029-8018(91)90027-N
(Fig. 3b, Figs. 5b-c: depth 40b, draught 3.65b, spacing 5b).

The parameters taken:
- three identical vertical circular cylinders, radius b = 3 m, draft 10.95 m, their axes at the
  corners of an equilateral triangle of side 15 m about the origin, cylinder 1 at (15/sqrt(3), 0);
  Table 3 of Raghavan et al. lists "Radius, b: 6 m", read as the diameter (Mavrakos' ratios give
  b = 3 m);
- water depth 120 m (DEPTH = math.inf gives the infinite-depth case of Raghavan et al.'s timing
  table); heading 0 deg;
- 900 low-order panels on each cylinder (Raghavan et al., Fig. 11): 30 around, 20 down the side,
  10 across the bottom, the whole surface;
- the six rigid modes of each cylinder about its origin on the axis in the free surface.

The choices: the interior free surface of each cylinder is panelled ("graded") to remove the
irregular frequencies; the motions are not solved.

Prints, at k b = 0.6, Mavrakos' coefficients a_i1^qp / pi = A / (rho pi b^3) and b_i1^qp / pi =
B / (rho omega pi b^3) (b^4 for the pitch-surge i = 5; qp = 11, 22 a cylinder's own, 12 the surge
force or pitch moment on cylinder 1 from the surge of cylinder 2) beside the values read by eye from
his Figs. 5b and 5c (reading accuracy about 0.05), and the differences. The full comparison
is in the validation report, docs/validation/cases/three_truncated_cylinders.md.
