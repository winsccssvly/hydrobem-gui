"""Three floating truncated vertical cylinders on an equilateral triangle, by the higher-order method.

The case: Raghavan, Loukogeorgaki, Mantadakis, Metrikine & Lavidas (2024), HAMS-MREL, a new open
source multiple body solver for marine renewable energies, Renewable Energy 237, 121577,
doi:10.1016/j.renene.2024.121577, §3.3 "Case 3 - Three semi-submerged cylinders"; the configuration
of Mavrakos (1991), Hydrodynamic coefficients for groups of interacting vertical axisymmetric bodies,
Ocean Engineering 18(5), 485-515, doi:10.1016/0029-8018(91)90027-N (Figs. 5b-c).

The parameters taken: three cylinders of radius b = 3 m and draft 10.95 m at the corners of an
equilateral triangle of side 15 m (cylinder 1 at (15/sqrt(3), 0)), depth 120 m, heading 0 deg, the
six rigid modes of each about its origin on the axis in the free surface.

The choices: options.higher_order = True; the mesh is the named analytic shape "circular_cylinder"
(the exact side, bottom and waterplane), its quadrant stored (symmetry "xz_and_yz") and expanded by
the engine for each body at its position; the waterplane patch is the interior free surface
(interior_surface "detect"); mapping "nonuniform"; per patch 4 spans around the quadrant, 6 down the
side, 3 across the bottom and the waterplane, B-splines of order 3, Gauss orders 3 and 4.

Prints, at k b = 0.6, Mavrakos' coefficients A / (rho pi b^3) and B / (rho omega pi b^3) (b^4 for the
pitch-surge) beside the values read by eye from his Figs. 5b and 5c (reading accuracy about 0.05), and
the differences. The full comparison is in the validation report,
docs/validation/cases/three_truncated_cylinders.md.
