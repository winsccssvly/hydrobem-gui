"""The floating OWC with a light piston on its inner free surface, in the higher order.

The case: the floating OWC of Raghavan, Loukogeorgaki, Mantadakis, Metrikine & Lavidas (2024),
HAMS-MREL, a new open source multiple body solver for marine renewable energies, Renewable Energy
237, 121577, doi:10.1016/j.renene.2024.121577, §3.4 (Table 4: a vertical tube of inner radius
r1 = 2 m, outer radius r2 = 3 m and draft H = 10 m), its water column covered by a rigid piston of
zero thickness (the light piston of the OWC theory of D. V. Evans (1982), Wave-power absorption by
systems of oscillating surface pressure distributions, J. Fluid Mech. 114, 481-499,
doi:10.1017/S0022112082000196): a free-surface plate, the body "piston" of a plate only, its mass 1 %
of the water column's.

How the problem is posed (options.higher_order = True): the quadrant of the analytic shape
"moonpool_cylinder" (radius r2, draft H, moonpool_radius r1) with its parts, the outer wall
("side"), the bottom annulus, the inner wall ("moonpool_wall") and the inner free surface
("moonpool_surface"); the hull is the body of the first three patches, the piston the body of the
fourth patch as its free-surface plate; the hull's interior surface, the annulus r1 < r < r2 in
z = 0, is a mesh of its own of one revolved-segment analytic patch. The potential: B-splines of
order 3, Gauss orders 3 (outer) and 4 (inner); mapping "nonuniform" clusters the spans at the
edges. Infinite depth, heading 0 deg, both bodies in heave, the diffraction problem in the total
potential, the default with a free-surface plate (diffraction_formulation "auto", not set here;
inside the column the incident and the scattered wave nearly cancel at the higher frequencies).

Also computed, as in run.py: A(infinity), the limit omega = infinity added to the frequencies, and
the mean drift of both bodies by momentum conservation in the far field (H. Maruo (1960), The drift
of a body floating on waves, J. Ship Res. 4(3), 1-10; J. N. Newman (1967), The drift force and
moment on ships in waves, J. Ship Res. 11(1), 51-60, doi:10.5957/jsr.1967.11.1.51). The drift by
pressure integration and its quadratic QTFs need the uniform mapping here (the nonuniform profiles
meet the waterline, and the engine refuses them), and the potential QTF is of the low order: both
are in run.py.

Prints the heave RAOs of the piston (the motion of the inner free surface) and of the hull,
A(infinity) of the heave pair and the surge drift, and checks the energy relation of the two bodies'
heave in deep water, B_ij = omega^3 Re(X_i conj(X_j)) / (2 rho g^3) (J. N. Newman, Marine
Hydrodynamics, 1977, the energy and Haskind relations). No page of the validation report compares
this model of the column. The same tube, its water column modelled by a piston body that fills it,
is compared in docs/validation/cases/floating_owc_piston.md. The page
docs/validation/cases/floating_owc_cover.md is about another body, a smaller tube whose moonpool is
closed by a cover of the hull's own body, and docs/validation/cases/dock.md checks the plate against
independent solutions.
