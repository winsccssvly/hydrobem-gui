"""A floating oscillating water column (OWC) as two bodies: the hull and a piston filling its column.

The case: Raghavan, Loukogeorgaki, Mantadakis, Metrikine & Lavidas (2024), HAMS-MREL, a new open
source multiple body solver for marine renewable energies, Renewable Energy 237, 121577,
doi:10.1016/j.renene.2024.121577, §3.4 "Case 4 - Floating OWC" (Table 4, Figs. 14, 16-18): a
simplified spar-buoy OWC modelled by the two-body method, the hull and an imaginary rigid piston that
fills the inner water column over its whole length, the two meshes overlapping on the inner wall.

The parameters taken:
- the hull: a vertical circular tube, inner radius r1 = 2 m, outer radius r2 = 3 m, draft H = 10 m
  (outer wall, bottom annulus, inner wall), 640 low-order panels;
- the piston: a vertical circular cylinder of radius r1 and length H, top in z = 0 (its side on the
  hull's inner wall, its bottom disc in the plane of the hull's bottom), 384 low-order panels;
- 16 panels around (the paper gives the counts, not their division), the whole surface;
- infinite depth; heading 0 deg; both bodies with the six rigid modes about their origin on the axis
  in the free surface.

The choices: as in the paper no interior surface (the first irregular frequency, of the piston's
interior, is near omega = 3.4 rad/s, above the paper's range); the motions are not solved.

The piston's heave added mass is also computed at omega = infinity, where the free surface is
phi = 0. The column mass plus this A33 is close to the A33 at omega = infinity of the massless plate
piston of the example floating_owc_cover, which models the same column by a free-surface plate on
its water (theory §9.7 of the documentation), and a little larger: the rigid piston holds the
column's water to one motion that the plate leaves free (Kelvin's minimum energy theorem; 0.5 % in
the higher order of both examples).

Prints the piston's heave added mass and damping (the paper's Figs. 17 and 18; its damping peaks at
about 760 kg/s near omega = 0.765 rad/s) at three frequencies and its added mass at omega = infinity,
and checks the energy relation of the two bodies' heave: for axisymmetric bodies in deep water the
heave radiates the axisymmetric wave only, and B_ij = omega^3 Re(X_i conj(X_j)) / (2 rho g^3), X the
heave exciting forces of the hull and the piston (the energy and Haskind relations, J. N. Newman,
Marine Hydrodynamics, 1977). The full comparison is in the validation report,
docs/validation/cases/floating_owc_piston.md.
