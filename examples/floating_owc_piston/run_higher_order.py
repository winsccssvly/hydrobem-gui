"""A floating oscillating water column (OWC) as two bodies, the hull and a piston filling its column,
by the higher-order method.

The case: Raghavan, Loukogeorgaki, Mantadakis, Metrikine & Lavidas (2024), HAMS-MREL, a new open
source multiple body solver for marine renewable energies, Renewable Energy 237, 121577,
doi:10.1016/j.renene.2024.121577, §3.4 "Case 4 - Floating OWC": the two-body method, the hull of the
OWC and an imaginary rigid piston that fills its water column, the piston's side on the hull's inner
wall.

The parameters taken: the hull a tube of inner radius r1 = 2 m, outer radius r2 = 3 m and draft
H = 10 m; the piston of radius r1 and length H; infinite depth, heading 0 deg, both bodies with their
six rigid modes about their origin on the axis in the free surface, no interior surface.

The choices: options.higher_order = True; quadrants of two analytic shapes (symmetry "xz_and_yz"),
the hull "moonpool_cylinder" (outer wall "side", bottom annulus, inner wall "moonpool_wall") and the
piston "circular_cylinder" (side, bottom disc); mapping "nonuniform" clusters the spans at the bottom
edges; B-splines of order 3, Gauss orders 3 and 4. The geometry is exact (circles, where the paper's
meshes are 16-sided polygons of 2.5 per cent less area: its A33 and B33 lie a few per cent lower).

The piston's heave added mass is also computed at omega = infinity, where the free surface is
phi = 0. The column mass plus this A33 is close to the A33 at omega = infinity of the massless plate
piston of the example floating_owc_cover, which models the same column by a free-surface plate on
its water (theory §9.7 of the documentation), and a little larger: the rigid piston holds the
column's water to one motion that the plate leaves free (Kelvin's minimum energy theorem; 0.5 % in
the higher order of both examples).

Prints the piston's heave added mass and damping at three frequencies and its added mass at
omega = infinity, and checks the energy relation of the two bodies' heave in deep water,
B_ij = omega^3 Re(X_i conj(X_j)) / (2 rho g^3), X the heave exciting forces of the hull and the
piston (the energy and Haskind relations, J. N. Newman, Marine Hydrodynamics, 1977). The full
comparison is in the validation report, docs/validation/cases/floating_owc_piston.md.
