"""The force of the second-order potential on a fixed bottom-mounted cylinder against Kim & Yue (1990).

The case: M.-H. Kim & D. K. P. Yue (1990), The complete second-order diffraction solution for an
axisymmetric body. Part 2. Bichromatic incident waves and body motions, J. Fluid Mech. 211,
557-593, doi:10.1017/S0022112090001690, table 3: a vertical circular cylinder of radius a standing
on the sea bed in water of depth h = a, fixed, in two regular waves of amplitudes A_j, A_l along
+x. The table gives the modulus of the horizontal force of the second-order potential at the
difference and the sum frequency, |f_2| / (rho g a A_j A_l), by their semi-analytic method, three
decimals each (the four values of KIM_YUE below), with nu = omega^2/g the deep-water wavenumber of
each first-order frequency. The force of the
second-order potential is the part of the second-order force that the quadratic products of the
first-order solution leave out (the potential QTF); the quadratic part is not compared here.

The parameters taken:
- the cylinder of radius a = 1 m in the depth h = 1 m (h/a = 1), rho = 1000 kg/m^3,
  g = 9.80665 m/s^2, heading 0 deg;
- the four first-order frequencies nu a = 1.0, 1.4, 1.6 and 2.0 (omega = sqrt(nu g)); the pairs
  of the table are among the pairs of the solve, which computes every pair;
- the normalization of the table: |f_2| / (rho g a A_j A_l), the surge force of the QTF per unit
  amplitudes.

The choices of the example:
- low-order panels on one quadrant of the wall (the symmetry planes x = 0 and y = 0 give the
  rest; no bottom: the cylinder stands on the sea bed): 12 around the quarter circle and 12 down
  the side, cosine-spaced in depth; no interior surface;
- the free surface of the potential QTF as the engine generates it by default: panels from the
  waterline to the inner radius R = 4a, their size the automatic one (a third of the shortest
  combined wavelength, at most a/4), the quadrature zone and the far field automatic;
- the potential QTF by both methods of the engine in one solve: indirect (Green's identity with an
  assisting radiation potential, qtf_potential_indirect) and direct (the second-order potential
  solved, qtf_potential_direct); they discretize the same problem in two ways and agree to the
  discretization error;
- the free surface keeps its automatic panel size on every body mesh, so the differences from the
  three-decimal values do not fall further with a finer body mesh (they stay within about 1 %);
- one frequency is solved at a time (FREQUENCY_THREADS = 1; more threads give the same results).

Prints the model, the summary of the results and the four values of both methods beside Kim &
Yue's, with the largest relative difference; saves out/run/second_order_bottom_cylinder.hbr. The
full comparison is in the validation report, docs/validation/cases/second_order_bottom_cylinder.md.
