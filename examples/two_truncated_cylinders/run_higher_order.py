"""Two floating truncated vertical cylinders side by side in finite depth, by the higher-order method.

The case: Raghavan, Loukogeorgaki, Mantadakis, Metrikine & Lavidas (2024), HAMS-MREL, a new open
source multiple body solver for marine renewable energies, Renewable Energy 237, 121577,
doi:10.1016/j.renene.2024.121577, §3.1 "Case 1 - Semi-immersed cylinders"; geometry 2 of Kagemoto &
Yue (1986), Interactions among multiple three-dimensional bodies in water waves: an exact algebraic
method, J. Fluid Mech. 166, 189-209, doi:10.1017/S0022112086000101.

The parameters taken: two cylinders D = 4 m, H = 4 m, 5.2 m apart along x, depth 8 m, heading 0 deg,
both with their six rigid modes about their origin on the axis in the free surface.

The choices: options.higher_order = True; the mesh is the named analytic shape "circular_cylinder"
(the exact side, bottom and waterplane), its quadrant stored (symmetry "xz_and_yz") and expanded by
the engine for each body at its position; the waterplane patch in z = 0 is the interior free surface
(interior_surface "detect"), which removes the irregular frequencies; mapping "nonuniform" clusters
the spans at the waterline and the bottom edge. Per patch 4 spans around the quadrant, 6 down the
side, 3 across the bottom and the waterplane, B-splines of order 3, Gauss orders 3 and 4.

Prints the totals over the two cylinders of Kagemoto & Yue (F1, N11, M11, F3, M33 in their
normalization (4.1)) at k D = 3.1 beside their table 2, and the largest relative difference. The full
comparison is in the validation report, docs/validation/cases/two_truncated_cylinders.md.
