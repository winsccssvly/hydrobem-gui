"""The floating circular dock of zero draft in finite depth, in the higher order.

The case: C. J. R. Garrett (1971), Wave forces on a circular dock, J. Fluid Mech. 46, 129-139,
doi:10.1017/S0022112071000430: a rigid circular disc of radius a floating in the free surface in
water of depth h = 2a, heaving. The reference: its added mass and damping by eigenfunction matching
(Garrett 1971; R. W. Yeung (1981), Added mass and damping of a vertical cylinder in finite-depth
waters, Applied Ocean Research 3, 119-133, doi:10.1016/0141-1187(81)90101-2, with the draft
d = 0), computed with HydroBEM's script scripts/gen_cylinder_reference.py (d = 0, the truncations
200, 400 and 800 extrapolated; converged to 1e-8).

The parameters taken: the disc of radius a = 10 m in z = 0, the depth h = 20 m, rho = 1000 kg/m^3,
g = 9.80665 m/s^2; Ka = 0.4, 0.8 and 1.5 and the limit omega = infinity; the radiation problem of
heave, and for the drift the diffraction problem of the heading 0 deg and the motions (the dock
free in heave, massless).

How the problem is posed (options.higher_order = True): the disc is a free-surface plate of the
body "dock", a body of a plate only. Its mesh: the quadrant of the disc as one analytic patch, a
radial line from the edge to the centre revolved through 90 degrees (map "line", the radius and z
of its ends in p; either direction: a plate is turned to face the water), the potential a
B-spline of order 3 on 6 x 8 spans (around, along the radius), Gauss orders 3 (outer) and 4
(inner).

Also computed, as in run.py: A33 at omega = infinity (in deep water half of the disc's (8/3) rho a^3
in unbounded fluid, J. N. Newman (1977), Marine Hydrodynamics, MIT Press, Fig. 4.8) and the mean
surge drift by momentum conservation (H. Maruo (1960), The drift of a body floating on waves,
J. Ship Res. 4(3), 1-10), the one drift available for a plate whose edge borders the free surface
(the velocity is singular at that edge; theory §9.7 of the documentation).

Prints A33/(rho a^3) and B33/(rho omega a^3) beside the eigenfunction matching, A33(infinity) and
the drift, and checks the largest relative difference of A33 and B33. The full comparison is in the
validation report, docs/validation/cases/dock.md.
