"""The experiments' model of a cylinder with a thin heave plate at the shallow draft: the surge exciting
force, the wave radiated in surge at a wave gauge (a field point) and the mean drift force.

run_model_scale.py: out/run_model_scale/plate_shallow_radiation.hbr and plate_shallow_diffraction.hbr

The case: S.-Y. Han, B. Bouscasse, V. Leroy, D. Le Touze (2024), Linear diffraction and radiation
theory of water waves by a truncated vertical circular cylinder with heave plate in deep and shallow
drafts, International Journal of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering 16, 100580,
doi:10.1016/j.ijnaoe.2023.100580, Figs. 9 and 11: the lines of its analytical method (matched
eigenfunction expansions) for the models of the experiments. The reference values below are read by
eye from the page images of the figures (the paper has no tables of results).

The parameters taken (Table 2, Section 4): the cylinder D_c = 0.35 m with the plate D_d = 1.00 m,
t_d = 0.005 m at the shallow draft d = 0.25 m (to the plate's bottom), the depth of the tank
h = 5.0 m, heading 0; three frequencies omega^2 D_c / g = 1, 1.15 and 1.5. The quantities: the
exciting force F_x / (rho g D_c^2 A) of the fixed model (Fig. 9 (a)), the mean drift force
F_x / (rho g D_c A^2) of the fixed model by momentum conservation (Fig. 9 (b)), and the amplitude
|eta| / xi_1 of the wave radiated in surge at the wave gauge r / D_c = 4, theta = pi (WG3, on the
side the waves come from; Fig. 11 (a)).

The choices of the example: the plate a disc of its thickness, part of the hull (its rim carries a
part of F_x at this draft); low-order panels on a quadrant, the meridian divided into cosine-spaced
intervals of at most D_c / 18, the plate's D_c / 36, 24 panels around the quadrant; the interior
surface "graded". Two solves: the radiation problems with the field point in z = 0 (its pressure
p / (rho g) per unit motion is the elevation), and the diffraction of the fixed body (modes none)
with its drift (the drift of a moving body needs its motions). One frequency is solved at a time
(FREQUENCY_THREADS = 1). The measurements of the paper include the viscous effects of the flow
separating at the plate's edge and are not compared.

Prints: the two models and their summaries, then F_x, the drift and the radiated wave beside the
values read from the figures, with the largest relative difference (the reading is good to a few
per cent). The full comparison is in the validation report,
docs/validation/cases/cylinder_with_heave_plate.md.
