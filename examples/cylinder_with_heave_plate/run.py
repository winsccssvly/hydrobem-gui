"""A truncated vertical circular cylinder with a thick heave plate at its bottom: exciting forces, added
mass and damping in surge, heave and pitch.

The case: S.-Y. Han, B. Bouscasse, V. Leroy, D. Le Touze (2024), Linear diffraction and radiation
theory of water waves by a truncated vertical circular cylinder with heave plate in deep and shallow
drafts, International Journal of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering 16, 100580,
doi:10.1016/j.ijnaoe.2023.100580: a surface-piercing cylinder (diameter D_c) standing on a coaxial
circular plate (diameter D_d, thickness t_d, its bottom at the draft d), at rest, solved there by
matched eigenfunction expansions (its lines "MEEM" in the figures). The paper has no tables of
results: the reference values below are read by eye from the page image of its Fig. 4.

The parameters taken (Table 1, the cylinder with the thick plate, after the DeepCwind platform):
D_c = 12 m, D_d = 24 m, the draft d = 20 m to the plate's bottom, t_d = 6 m, the depth h = 100 m,
heading 0 (waves along +x); three frequencies omega^2 D_c / g = 0.5, 1 and 2 of the figure's range
0.05 ... 3. The normalization of the figure: F_x / (rho g D_c^2 A) (A the wave amplitude),
a_33 / (rho D_c^3), b_ii / (omega rho D_c^n); pitch about the origin in the free surface on the axis.

The choices of the example: low-order panels on a quadrant (symmetry about x = 0 and y = 0), the
meridian divided into cosine-spaced intervals (small at the waterline and at every corner) of at
most D_c / 18, 24 panels around the quadrant; the plate a disc of its thickness, part of the hull.
The interior surface "graded" removes the irregular frequencies. The body is at rest: the radiation
and the diffraction problems, no motions. One frequency is solved at a time (FREQUENCY_THREADS = 1;
more threads give the same results).

Prints: the model, the summary of the results, and F_x and a_33 at the three frequencies beside
the values read from Fig. 4, with the largest relative difference (the reading is good to about
1 per cent). The full comparison is in the validation report,
docs/validation/cases/cylinder_with_heave_plate.md.
