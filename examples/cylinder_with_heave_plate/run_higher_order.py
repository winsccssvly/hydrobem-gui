"""The cylinder with the thick heave plate and with the thin plate (a dipole patch) by the higher-order
method, on exact geometry: added mass in heave against Han et al. (2024).

run_higher_order.py: both bodies, out/run_higher_order/thick_plate.hbr and thin_plate.hbr

The case: S.-Y. Han, B. Bouscasse, V. Leroy, D. Le Touze (2024), Linear diffraction and radiation
theory of water waves by a truncated vertical circular cylinder with heave plate in deep and shallow
drafts, International Journal of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering 16, 100580,
doi:10.1016/j.ijnaoe.2023.100580, Figs. 4 and 6 (matched eigenfunction expansions). The reference
values below are read by eye from the page images of the figures (the paper has no tables).

The parameters taken (Table 1): the thick plate (after DeepCwind) D_c = 12 m, D_d = 24 m, the draft
d = 20 m to the plate's bottom, t_d = 6 m; the thin plate (after HiPRWind) D_c = 7 m, D_d = 20 m,
d = 15.5 m, modelled as a sheet in its mid-plane z = -15.45 m; the depth h = 100 m, heading 0; three
frequencies omega^2 D_c / g = 0.05 (0.5 for the thick plate), 1 and 2. The normalization of the
figures: a_33 / (rho D_c^3).

The choices of the example: analytic patches, each a quadrant of a revolved straight segment of the
meridian (the map "line", exact circles), one patch per segment: the wetted hull, the waterplane
disc r < D_c / 2 in z = 0 as the interior surface (interior_surface "mesh"), and for the thin plate
the annulus D_c / 2 < r < D_d / 2, a dipole patch of the same mesh. The potential on each patch:
B-splines of order 3 (Gauss orders 3 and 4), the spans at most D_c / 8 along the meridian and around
the quadrant; the profile "smooth" clusters the spans at the ends of each segment, at the waterline,
the corners and the sheet's free edge, where the flow is singular. The sheet's edge converges here in
one solve (the low order of run_thin_plate.py errs in proportion to its interval across the sheet).
One frequency is solved at a time (FREQUENCY_THREADS = 1).

Prints: for each body the model and the summary of the results, then a_33 of both bodies beside the
values read from the figures, with the largest relative difference (the reading is good to about
1 per cent). The full comparison is in the validation report,
docs/validation/cases/cylinder_with_heave_plate.md.
