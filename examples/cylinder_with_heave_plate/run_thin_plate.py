"""A truncated vertical circular cylinder with a thin heave plate, the plate a dipole sheet: added mass in
surge and heave.

run_thin_plate.py: the thin plate, low-order panels, out/run_thin_plate/thin_plate.hbr

The case: S.-Y. Han, B. Bouscasse, V. Leroy, D. Le Touze (2024), Linear diffraction and radiation
theory of water waves by a truncated vertical circular cylinder with heave plate in deep and shallow
drafts, International Journal of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering 16, 100580,
doi:10.1016/j.ijnaoe.2023.100580, Fig. 6: the cylinder with the thin plate, solved there by matched
eigenfunction expansions. The reference values below are read by eye from the page image of Fig. 6
(the paper has no tables of results).

The parameters taken (Table 1, after the HiPRWind platform): D_c = 7 m, D_d = 20 m, the draft
d = 15.5 m to the plate's bottom, t_d = 0.1 m, the depth h = 100 m, heading 0; three frequencies
omega^2 D_c / g = 0.05, 0.5 and 1 of the figure's range 0.05 ... 3. The normalization of the figure:
a_11 / (rho D_c^3), a_33 / (rho D_c^3).

The choices of the example: the plate is modelled without thickness, a dipole sheet (a body's
`dipoles`) in its mid-plane z = -15.45 m: the annulus D_c / 2 < r < D_d / 2, both faces wetted; the
cylinder's side and bottom are the hull. Low-order panels on a quadrant, the hull's meridian divided
into cosine-spaced intervals of at most D_c / 18, the sheet's of at most D_c / 36, 24 panels around
the quadrant; the interior surface "graded". The sheet's free edge carries the singularity of the
flow around it, where constant panels converge slowly, with an error proportional to the interval
across the sheet (a_33 lies about 1.5 per cent above the converged value here; two sheets and the
extrapolation 2 fine - coarse, or the higher order of run_higher_order.py, remove it). One frequency
is solved at a time (FREQUENCY_THREADS = 1).

Prints: the model, the summary of the results, and a_11, a_33 at the three frequencies beside the
values read from Fig. 6, with the largest relative difference. The full comparison is in the
validation report, docs/validation/cases/cylinder_with_heave_plate.md.
