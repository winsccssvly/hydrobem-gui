"""A freely floating circular fish tank in waves: surge, pitch and the sloshing of the fluid inside.

run.py: the tank free in surge and pitch in waves (Fig. 2 of the paper), low-order panels:
    out/run/fish_tank_d2.hbr (the model with its results)

The case: J. N. Newman (2021), Linear motions of fish tanks, 36th International Workshop on Water
Waves and Floating Bodies (IWWWFB), 25-28 April 2021: circular cylindrical tanks with vertical axes
floating in infinite depth, the tank's wall of zero thickness separating the fluid inside (the same
density, its free surface at the same height) from the sea outside, so that there is neither a
rigid-body mass nor a hydrostatic restoring moment; surge, pitch and the first sloshing mode.

The parameters taken:
- radius a = 1, draft d = 2 (the paper's drafts are 0.5, 0.715278, 1 and 2; set DRAFT for another),
  infinite depth, the density and the gravity 1, so that the results are the paper's nondimensional
  ones (lengths in units of a, K = omega^2 / g the wavenumber outside, the pitch in radians);
- the origin and the centre of rotation at the centre of the interior free surface;
- incident waves along +x of unit amplitude; the wavenumbers K = 0.05 and every 0.002 from 1.801 to
  1.899 around the first sloshing wavenumber K1 = k1 tanh(k1 d) = 1.8389 (none at K1 itself, where
  the coefficients of the tank are infinite);
- the sloshing amplitude: the elevation of the interior free surface at x = 0.9, y = 0.

The model: the hull (side and bottom, normals out into the sea) and the tank (the same panels with
their vertices reversed, normals into the tank) are two sets of elements of one mesh on the same
cylinder: the wall of zero thickness is two coincident surfaces with opposite normals. The tank has
the density of the sea (density_ratio 1) and its free surface at z = 0; its added mass and
hydrostatics are added to the body's, and the restoring of surge and pitch cancels to zero, as in the
paper. The body itself is massless (mass 0, a zero inertia), and the engine solves its motions with
the inertia of the water alone, (C - omega^2 A + i omega B) xi = X (physics section 8); the sloshing
amplitude is the sum of the motions times the tank's elevation per unit motion.

The mesh: a quadrant (the planes x = 0 and y = 0 are symmetry planes), 16 panels around, 32 down the
side and 14 across the bottom, cosine-spaced; the interior surface "graded" removes the irregular
frequencies of the exterior problem. The polygon of 64 sides puts the panel model's K1 0.003 above
the exact one (run_higher_order.py: on it).

What the script prints: the surge RAO at K = 0.05 (it tends to 1 as K -> 0) and the check: the zeros
of xi1 and xi5 with both modes free just above K1 against the paper's values for d = 2 (Section 3:
K = 1.841 and 1.845). The full comparison is in the validation report,
docs/validation/cases/fish_tank_cylinders.md.
