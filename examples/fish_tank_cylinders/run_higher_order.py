"""The freely floating fish tank of run.py by the higher-order method, on exact geometry.

run_higher_order.py: the tank free in surge and pitch in waves (Fig. 2 of the paper), analytic patches:
    out/run_higher_order/fish_tank_d2.hbr (the model with its results)

The case: J. N. Newman (2021), Linear motions of fish tanks, 36th International Workshop on Water
Waves and Floating Bodies (IWWWFB), 25-28 April 2021: a circular cylindrical tank with a wall of zero
thickness floating in infinite depth, the fluid inside of the sea's density with its free surface at
the same height; surge, pitch and the first sloshing mode.

The parameters taken (as run.py): radius a = 1, draft d = 2, infinite depth, the density and the
gravity 1 (the paper's nondimensional results, K = omega^2 / g), the origin at the centre of the
interior free surface, waves along +x of unit amplitude at K = 0.05 and every 0.002 from 1.801 to
1.899 around the first sloshing wavenumber K1 = k1 tanh(k1 d) = 1.8389, the sloshing amplitude at
x = 0.9, y = 0.

The mesh: analytic patches, each a quadrant of a revolved straight segment of the meridian (the map
"line", exact circles), five elements of one mesh: the hull's side and bottom (the wetted surface,
normals out into the sea), the waterplane disc r < 1 in z = 0 (the interior surface that removes the
irregular frequencies of the exterior problem) and the tank's side and bottom, the hull's two surfaces
traversed the other way (normals into the tank); the tank takes elements of the body's mesh. The
potential: B-splines of order 3 (Gauss orders 3 and 4), spans at most 0.25 long; along the meridian
the profile clusters the spans at the bottom corner, where the exterior flow is singular. The body
is massless (mass 0, a zero inertia): the engine solves its motions with the inertia of the water
alone, (C - omega^2 A + i omega B) xi = X (physics section 8). The exact circle puts the panel
model's K1 on the exact one (run.py's polygon: 0.003 above it), so the zeros below lie where the
paper has them.

What the script prints: the surge RAO at K = 0.05 and the check: the zeros of xi1 and xi5 with both
modes free just above K1 against the paper's values for d = 2 (Section 3: K = 1.841 and 1.845). The
full comparison is in the validation report, docs/validation/cases/fish_tank_cylinders.md.
