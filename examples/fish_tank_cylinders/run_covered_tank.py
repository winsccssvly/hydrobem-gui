"""The forced surge and pitch of a circular fish tank whose free surface is open, half covered by a
deck or fully covered: plates of the tank's free surface.

run_covered_tank.py: the tank of run_forced_tank.py (a = 1, d = 1), low-order panels:
    out/run_covered_tank/fish_tank_covered.hbr (the model with the half-covered tank, with its results)

The case: the tank of J. N. Newman (2021), Linear motions of fish tanks, 36th International Workshop
on Water Waves and Floating Bodies (IWWWFB), 25-28 April 2021, Fig. 1, forced in surge and pitch,
with a rigid plate lying on the tank's free surface: none (the open tank of run_forced_tank.py), an
annular deck from the wall to the radius a / sqrt(2) (half the free surface covered, the water open
in the middle) and a full cover. The plates are free-surface plates of the tank's problem
(tank.free_surface_plates): massless, rigid, moving with the body, with the tank fluid below them
only (theory §9.7 and §10.2 of the documentation). A full cover makes the tank a closed container
filled with water: in surge the fluid then moves as a rigid body (the potential phi = x meets the
condition on every wall and on the cover), and the tank's added masses are those of its fluid mass
M = rho pi a^2 d at its centre z = -d/2, A11 = M and A15 = -M d/2, independent of the frequency.
The half cover leaves the fluid a smaller free surface to slosh on: the added masses change sign
through the first sloshing resonance between K = 2.5 and 3.5, above that of the open tank
(K1 = k1 tanh(k1 d) = 1.7508, k1 the first zero of J1').

The parameters taken: radius a = 1, draft d = 1, the density and the gravity 1 (lengths in units
of the radius, K = omega^2 / g), the wavenumbers K = 0.5, 1, 2.5 and 3.5; the hull and the tank two
sets of elements of one mesh (a quadrant, 16 panels around, 24 down the side and 14 across the
bottom, cosine-spaced, as in run_forced_tank.py); the plates meshes of their own in z = 0, 16
panels around (their edges on the wall's panels) and 6 rings. The tank's added mass is the
difference of two solves of the same hull, with the tank and without it.

What the script prints: A11, A15 and A55 per unit density of the tank alone, open, half covered and
covered, at the four wavenumbers, and the check: A11 and A15 of the covered tank against M and
-M d/2, the largest difference relative to M.
