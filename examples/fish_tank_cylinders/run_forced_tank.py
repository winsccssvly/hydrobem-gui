"""The forced surge and pitch of a circular fish tank with no fluid outside: its added masses against
the closed-form interior series. Requires SciPy.

run_forced_tank.py: the tank alone (Fig. 1 of the paper), low-order panels:
    out/run_forced_tank/fish_tank_forced_d1.hbr (the model with the tank, with its results)

The case: J. N. Newman (2021), Linear motions of fish tanks, 36th International Workshop on Water
Waves and Floating Bodies (IWWWFB), 25-28 April 2021, Fig. 1: the added masses A11, A15 and A55 of the
fluid inside a circular cylindrical tank forced in surge and pitch, and the closed-form interior
solution of O. M. Faltinsen, A. N. Timokha (2009), Sloshing, Cambridge University Press, Section
5.4.4, as in the paper's appendix (eqs. 2-7).

The parameters taken: radius a = 1, draft d = 1 (the paper's drafts are 0.5, 0.715278, 1 and 2; set
DRAFT for another), the density and the gravity 1 (the paper's nondimensional results, K = omega^2 / g),
the origin and the centre of rotation at the centre of the tank's free surface, the wavenumbers
K = 0.5, 1, 2.5 and 3.5 (away from the first sloshing wavenumber K1 = k1 tanh(k1 d) = 1.7508, where
the panels' shift of K1 dominates the difference).

The model: the hull (side and bottom, normals out into the sea) and the tank (the same panels with
their vertices reversed, normals into the tank) are two sets of elements of one mesh. The results hold
the added mass of a body with its tanks, not that of a tank alone: the tank's is the difference of
two solves of the same hull, with the tank and without it (the two fluids do not influence each
other, so the parts of the sea cancel). The mesh: a quadrant, 16 panels around, 24 down the side and
14 across the bottom, cosine-spaced; the interior surface "graded" for the exterior problem.

The series, derived here for the potentials per unit velocity, the normal into the tank fluid and
A_ij = -rho times the integral of n_i phi_j over the wall (physics section 3). With k_n the zeros of
J1', a_n = 2 / (k_n^2 - 1) and C, S, T the cosh, sinh and tanh of k_n d:
- surge: c_n = K a_n / (k_n S - K C), A11 = pi (d + sum c_n S / k_n);
- pitch about the origin: beta_n = -2 a_n / k_n, alpha_n = [a_n + beta_n (k_n C - K S)] / (K C - k_n S),
  A55 = pi [d^3/3 - d/4 + sum ((alpha_n (2 - C) - beta_n S) / k_n^2 + beta_n d / k_n)],
  A15 = pi [-d^2/2 + sum (alpha_n S + beta_n (C - 1)) / k_n];
200 terms, written with exp(-k_n d) so that nothing overflows.

What the script prints: A11, A15 and A55 per unit density of the panels and of the series at the four
wavenumbers, and the check: their largest difference relative to the largest |value| of each
quantity. The full comparison is in the validation report,
docs/validation/cases/fish_tank_cylinders.md.
