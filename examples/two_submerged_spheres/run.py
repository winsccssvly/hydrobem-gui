"""Two submerged spheres side by side in infinite depth, waves at 45 degrees.

The case: Raghavan, Loukogeorgaki, Mantadakis, Metrikine & Lavidas (2024), HAMS-MREL, a new open
source multiple body solver for marine renewable energies, Renewable Energy 237, 121577,
doi:10.1016/j.renene.2024.121577, §3.2 "Case 2 - Two submerged spheres". It is case 2 of Wu (1995),
The interaction of water waves with a group of submerged spheres, Applied Ocean Research 17(3),
165-184, doi:10.1016/0141-1187(95)00010-0 (Fig. 1, §7, Figs. 2-10).

The parameters taken:
- two identical spheres of radius a = 3 m, centre-to-centre spacing 4a = 12 m along the x axis, their
  centres 1.5a = 4.5 m below the free surface (Wu §7; Table 2 of Raghavan et al. lists 9 m, but their
  curves, which agree with Wu's, are those of 4.5 m);
- infinite depth; heading 45 deg;
- 625 low-order panels on each sphere (Raghavan et al., Fig. 6): 25 meridians by 25 bands of
  latitude, the whole surface;
- the six rigid modes of each sphere about its centre.

The choices: submerged bodies have no interior surface and no irregular frequencies; the motions are
not solved (a neutrally buoyant submerged sphere has no hydrostatic restoring).

Prints, at nu a = 1 (nu = omega^2/g), Wu's quantities of sphere 2 with both spheres moving in the same
mode: a_jj = (A21 + A22) / (rho (4/3) pi a^3), b_jj = (B21 + B22) / (rho omega (4/3) pi a^3) and
f_j = |E2_j| / (rho omega^2 (4/3) pi a^3 A exp(-nu a)), beside the values read by eye from his
Figs. 2-10 (reading accuracy about 1 per cent), and the largest relative difference. The full
comparison is in the validation report, docs/validation/cases/two_submerged_spheres.md.
