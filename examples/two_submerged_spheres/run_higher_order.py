"""Two submerged spheres side by side in infinite depth, waves at 45 degrees, by the higher-order method.

The case: Raghavan, Loukogeorgaki, Mantadakis, Metrikine & Lavidas (2024), HAMS-MREL, a new open
source multiple body solver for marine renewable energies, Renewable Energy 237, 121577,
doi:10.1016/j.renene.2024.121577, §3.2 "Case 2 - Two submerged spheres"; case 2 of Wu (1995), The
interaction of water waves with a group of submerged spheres, Applied Ocean Research 17(3), 165-184,
doi:10.1016/0141-1187(95)00010-0 (Figs. 2-10).

The parameters taken: two spheres of radius a = 3 m, 12 m apart along x, their centres 4.5 m below the
free surface, infinite depth, heading 45 deg, the six rigid modes of each about its centre.

The choices: options.higher_order = True; the exact sphere as one analytic patch per quadrant, the
revolved arc (map "arc") of the meridian from the top pole to the bottom pole, centred at the mesh
origin, stored as the quadrant x, y >= 0 (symmetry "xz_and_yz") and expanded by the engine for each
body; each body is placed with its centre at its position (x = -6 or +6 m, z = -4.5 m), so the
rotation centre and the centre of gravity are the body origin. Per patch 4 spans around the quadrant
and 8 down the meridian, B-splines of order 3, Gauss orders 3 and 4. No interior surface: the spheres
are submerged.

Prints, at nu a = 1, Wu's quantities of sphere 2 with both spheres moving in the same mode (a_jj,
b_jj, f_j in his normalization) beside the values read by eye from his Figs. 2-10, and the largest
relative difference. The full comparison is in the validation report,
docs/validation/cases/two_submerged_spheres.md.
