"""A floating vertical cylinder in deep water, every input of the model written out.

run.py: the cylinder, out/run/cylinder.hbr (the model with its results) and the WAMIT-format numeric
files out/run/cylinder.1, .2, ... and .out (the example of every input and of every output).

Every item of the objects this case uses is given (the mesh items that only patch meshes and
trims have, and the list `tool`, are left out): the values of this case, the defaults as they
are, and None for what is not used (the lists of objects are empty here; the items of their
objects are in the comment beside). Change a value and run it again. The cylinder: radius 1 m,
draft 0.5 m, one quadrant of panels (the symmetry planes x = 0 and y = 0 give the rest).

How the model is edited:
- A single object (m.environment, m.options, m.first_order, m.second_order, a body): an item by
  assignment (m.options.inner_threads = 4), several at once by update(name=value, ...) (all or
  nothing), back to the default by reset("name") or by assigning None; read by attribute,
  items() (every own item and value, not its name nor its lists:
  m.bodies.add(name="b2", **b1.items()) copies them), info("name") (kind, unit, default, switch,
  description); print(obj) shows the items given that its switches choose and a line naming the unused ones. A name the
  object does not have is refused at once, and nothing changes.
- Where one of two inputs is used, a switch names it, both have defaults, and only the one named
  is read; the items of a choice not made are kept unused and not checked, and nothing is
  refused or reset when one is set: environment.frequency_input (omegas or periods), a body's
  inertia_input (Ixx ... Izz or radii_of_gyration), interior_surface and control_surface (the
  method of each surface, its items prefixed by its name; control_surface_outer chooses
  control_surface_radius or _boundary), second_order.free_surface_method (the free surface of the
  potential QTF, free_surface_*). A needed item of the choice made that is missing (a radius, a
  depth, a mesh ...) is refused by check() and the solve.
- A list of objects (m.bodies, m.meshes, m.lids, m.fixed_dampers, m.tool; of a body: dipoles,
  dipole_dampers, tanks, pressure_surfaces, free_surface_plates, generalized_modes, couplings; of a
  tank: dipoles,
  dipole_dampers; of a pressure surface: pressure_modes; of a generalized mode: pieces; of a mesh:
  patches): add(name, **items) returns the new object, insert(index, name, **items), lst[name] or
  lst[index] finds one, del lst[name] removes it (refused while another object refers to it),
  rename(old, new) (the references follow), move(name, index), names(), len(), iteration,
  clear() (empties it, all or nothing). Its objects are made only by add() and insert(), each
  with its own items; an object's own lists are filled once it is made
  (m.bodies["cylinder"].tanks.add(mesh=..., ranges=...)). A list is not assigned, nor given to
  add() or update().
- m.tool: a list of named texts that other programs (a graphical interface, a script) keep with
  the model; the solve does not read them (m.tool.add(name="my_gui", text="...")).
