"""A floating hemisphere in deep water: heave and surge added mass and damping against Hulme (1982).

The case: A. Hulme (1982), The wave forces acting on a floating hemisphere undergoing forced
periodic oscillations, J. Fluid Mech. 121, 443-463, doi:10.1017/S0022112082001980, tables 1 and 2:
the added mass and damping of the heave (his mode 0) and the surge (mode 1) of a hemisphere of
radius a floating with its equator in the free surface, in deep water.

The parameters taken:
- the hemisphere of radius a = 1 m, its centre in the free surface, deep water, rho = 1000 kg/m^3,
  g = 9.80665 m/s^2;
- three of the tabulated frequencies, Ka = 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 (K = omega^2/g);
- the radiation problems of surge and heave about the centre (no diffraction, no motions);
- the normalization of the tables: A/m0 and B/(omega m0) with m0 = 2 pi rho a^3/3, the displaced
  mass.

The choices of the example:
- low-order panels on one quadrant (the symmetry planes x = 0 and y = 0 give the rest), 32
  divisions from the waterline to the bottom pole and 32 around the quadrant (1024 panels; set
  DIVISIONS for a finer or coarser mesh), the polar divisions graded towards the waterline;
- the interior surface "projected" (the downward-facing panels projected onto z = 0) removes the
  irregular frequencies (the first near Ka = 3.9);
- one frequency is solved at a time (FREQUENCY_THREADS = 1; more threads give the same results).

Prints the model, the summary of the results and the four coefficients beside Hulme's values at
the three frequencies, with the largest difference relative to the largest tabulated value of each
quantity; saves out/run/floating_hemisphere.hbr. The full comparison is in the validation report,
docs/validation/cases/floating_hemisphere.md.
